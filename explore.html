                        The Forbidden City (Chinese name: 故宫 Gugong 'Former Palace') was the palatial heart of China.
                        It is an imperial palace complex of the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368–1912) in Beijing, China.
                        As one of the five most important palaces in the world, the grand halls and walls proudly
                        display the essence and culmination of traditional Chinese architecture, fitting for the capital
                        city of
                        the world's largest nation.

                    <strong style="font-size: medium;">Why it call as Forbidden City ?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: medium;">
                        The English name "Forbidden City" is a translation of the Chinese name Zijincheng (紫禁城
                        /dzrr-jin-chng/ ‘Purple Forbidden City’).
                        In ancient times, the emperor was said to be a son of Heaven, and therefore Heaven's supreme
                        power was bestowed upon him.Now, in China, it is usually called the "Former Palace" (故宫 Gugong
                        /goo-gong/).

                    <p style="font-size: medium;">
                        The Forbidden City is now 601 years old [2021]. It was built from 1406 to 1420 on the orders of
                        Zhu Di — Ming Dynasty Emperor Yongle (reign 1402–24).
                        Emperor Yongle was the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty. He seized the throne from his nephew.
                        In order to consolidate his imperial power and protect his own security, he decided to move the
                        capital from Nanjing to Beijing, which was his fief. Thus, Emperor Yongle ordered Kuai Xiang to
                        design the Forbidden City in Beijing.
                        The Forbidden City experienced three fires, and so most of present palaces were rebuilt during
                        the Qing Dynasty.
                        During the Second Opium War (1856–1860), the Forbidden City was controlled by Anglo-French
                        forces and occupied until the end of the war.
                        Puyi, the last emperor, lived in the Forbidden City until he was expelled in 1924. After that,
                        the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City was established and was opened to the public.

                        No trees! There are no trees in the Outer Court because emperors thought they would overshadow

                        disrupt the majesty of the atmosphere.

                        room
                        is missing to avoid upsetting the God of Heaven (who was believed to have 10,000 rooms in his
                        heavenly palace).
                        Higher-status palaces in the Forbidden City had more complex patterns of doors and windows.

                        The Leshan Giant Buddha is a statue of Maitreya (a Bodhisattva usually represented as a very
                        stout monk
                        with a broad smile on his face and with his naked breast and paunch exposed to view) in sitting
                        posture.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: medium;">
                        The Buddha is located to the east of Leshan City, Sichuan Province, at the confluence of three
                        rivers,
                        namely, Min River, Qingyi River, and Dadu River. The statue makes itself the most renowned
                        scenic spot
                        in that city.

                        In December, 1996, the location of the Buddha was included by UNESCO on the list of the World
                        Heritage sites.
                        Begun in the year 713 in the Tang Dynasty, and finished in the year 803, the statue took people
                        more than 90 years to carve.
                        As the biggest carved stone Buddha in the world, the Giant Buddha is featured in poetry, song
                        and story.
